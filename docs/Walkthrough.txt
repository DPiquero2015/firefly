You are the captain of a Firefly class ship fitted for hauling cargo. You are passing through a rather desolate region of the 'verse when the lights suddenly flicker and warning lights begin flashing on your console. The engine has given out. Not only is the ship helplessly stranded in space, but the life support systems are now inoperable. You must act quickly before you run out of both oxygen and heat...


To get info about the ship, type 'stats'. Objects and rooms may be more closely examined with 'look', and some objects can be taken with 'take'

It appears that the catalyzer on the port compression coil blew. That's where the trouble started.


>repair the engine
*** Plugging in the catalyer, the engine begins to turn. Power is restored and air begins to circulate throughout the ship. You survive.  ***
